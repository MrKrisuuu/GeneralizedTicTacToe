# GeneralizedTicTacToe

The program analyzes moves and generates the best answers based on the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta. It
determines the possible outcome of each move. You can change the size of the board and the number of pieces in the
line required to win (m,n,k-game).

Alfa-Beta don't work efficiently, because I don't have evaluation function (I have UNKNOWN states).

TODO list
- fix removing known boards
- think about better tree building
